# Scrimba-ColorPicking-Solo-Project

This is my first solo project with scrimba.
It was so much fun.

API, for loop, DOM munipulation-combining all of them together is so powerful.

I'm amazed with what I would do with JS.

# Code review

I'm sure there will be a much more obvious way to code this project. 
If you did this solo project as well, please tell me how you did it.
